# Rick&Morty React App

Simple React application to practice basic React features(styled components, context API), ES6 features and automatic deployment to Heroku using github actions. 

Why Rick&Morty? The application uses the Rick&Morty public api (https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/) to get data.

Deployed application available at https://rickandmortyreactapp.herokuapp.com/ (might take a few seconds to load-in, since it is a sleeping Heroku app).
